# jsonnet

These are some personal notes on [jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org/).
It is remarkably hard to find something good to deal with
duplication on configuration/description of deployments.
That is why I ended up taking a look into jsonnet, to my
surprise, overall, it is much better than I expected.

I usually dont expect much because almost everything that I tried
on this realm (like template engines, kustomize, etc) disappointed
severely.

Having said that, the notes are mostly based on reading the
[language reference](https://jsonnet.org/ref/language.html), I don't
have much personal experience with it yet.
