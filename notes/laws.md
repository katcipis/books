# Laws

Some laws on computer science that I collected, not that
they should be considered like actual laws and rules, but usually
they reflect good ideas and are good rules of thumb.

* [Hyrum's Law](http://www.hyrumslaw.com/)
* [Postel's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle) (Robustness Principle)
* [Amdahl's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law)
* [Demeter's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter)
