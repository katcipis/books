# The Soul of a New Machine

The idea of this [great book](https://www.amazon.com/Soul-New-Machine-Tracy-Kidder-ebook/dp/B005HG4W9W)
is to capture the essence of the
process of building a new machine, in this case a computer.
From what I understand this essence or soul of the machine
is comprised of pieces of the individuals that built it
that are left on this machine. Being so the history is much
more about the people building the machine than details
of the machine per se.

This is specially true given that the writer of the book
is a journalist, so he gives a really high level and romantic
view of the process of building the machine, giving emphasis on the
people around it and their behavior and aspirations. He wanted to
capture what motivated them.

There is a lot of people involved on the building of the machine,
but the main protagonist is Tom West, the guy that conceived
the idea of building the machine and sold it to the rest
of the company and helped assemble and motivate the team.

Besides that, for a great part of the book it seems that West 
is doing nothing besides giving creative freedom to the engineers
to conceive the machine, but as is said on the beginning of the book
and made clear at the end, there is more in building a machine than
designing and building a CPU.

The history begins with the construction of a new fancy research
lab that was supposed to be the new creative force behind Data General,
the company where the story happens. This lab was built in North Carolina
and the project was named Fountainhead,
far away from Data General headquarters in Westborough Massachusetts,
and a lot of the engineers did not wanted to move
out but also felt that they have been left behind to do meaningless
work and that all the fun would be on the new lab (the main reason was
tax incentives from the North Carolina government).

A war started to brew between the engineers at the Westborough and the
ones at North Carolina, and the winner would get to build a fancy/awesome
new 32 bits machine (called super minicomputers). The one leading the team
at Westborough was Tom West, the protagonist. Both teams made a proposal of
a machine and in the end Tom West and his team lost the battle, the new
fancy project was going to the new lab.

Here is where West ingenuity begins, he thought off and sold the idea of
a 32 bit machine that would be backward compatible with the current
16 bit machine, the Eclipse. Since it had to be backward compatible the
new machine would have much more constraints than the one being developed
at North Carolina, it would not be as pure and free of ugly hacks, it would
have to bear the burden of backwards compatibility. West was not selling
the idea of a cool from scratch awesome computer, he was selling insurance
in case the project at North Carolina went sideways, and insurance
was something that the board of directors was willing to buy.

At the same time he was selling the idea of building this machine to
the engineers as something extremely exciting (no one wants to build
insurance =P), as an opportunity to exert creative power and build
something that would have your name on it, a piece of you, your ideas.
But it was a tough sell, most engineers
thought about it as a "kludge", a depreciative term indicating
that the machine would have a lot of ugly hacks because of its
constraints of compatibility. But West was very good at convincing people,
he was relentless, and in the end he was able to assemble a great team.

West had the ability to turn every single aspect of the project,
even the more simple and boring ones, in something awesome, embedding
a sense of adventure into everything, he had the gift of making people
excited about the most mundane things, he was a very romantic person
in that sense. And it was this ability that was the driving force
compelling the team to crunch 80 hours weeks for more than a year.

The desire to build something that has a piece of yourself inside it.
The kinda of work that gives meaning to life, like the people who used
to build cathedrals, building temples to God, building something with
a strong sense of purpose. In the end the engineers worked for that ideal,
because they were not well paid and they didn't even got stock options,
it was all for the possibility of getting a machine out of the door,
a machine with your name on it, and not any machine, a good machine.
West also always talked about how they where saving the company, so
the team felt like heroes working against time (who doesn't want to
be a hero ?).

Lots of awesome stuff happened, like the engineer who built a full simulator
of the machine in two months just because they really needed it and he
had no idea that it was an impossible task, no one believed that it could
be done on that time frame, but he did not know that so in the end he did it.
He talked about sometimes it is even good to not talk with a lot of 
people about an idea, because they may convince you that it is not possible =P.

There is also some very interesting debugging stories, like one that involved
hardware interruptions and crossing memory boundaries, which seemed like something
really complex that involved the whole machine and in the end it was just
a memory board missing in the machine, the memory boundary that was crossed
ended up in memory that would be on a different memory board but no one
noticed the missing board. This reminds me of how most of the most serious
errors are usually caused by the most stupid things, and engineers (myself
included) always think that the cause is extremely complex.

And in the end they were pretty happy with the final result, even though in
the start everyone seemed to think on the project as a kludge. Even tough
the mantra of the project leader, West, was:

```
Not everything worth doing is worth doing well
```

The final result, even to the eyes of the engineers, seemed great.
They had though constraints, both in retro-compatibility and on time, the
company was already late to entry the 32 bits market and the dream team
at North Carolina was not delivering, and from these constraints a machine
was born, and even tough late on the market it was a success. It was able to
be compatible with the 16 bits Eclipse, giving to it an easy upgrade path to
people who owned Eclipses, and also perform faster than the current DEC
32 bits computer, a win/win.

Besides constraints the competition for resources inside the company between
Westborough and North Carolina are presented as beneficial, and this is another
characteristic that reminds nature itself, life emerges in the midst of a lot
of though constraints and life forms also compete for scarce resources, and in
the end we got the most impressive distributed system that we know of,
life on earth, which is far from perfect but very efficient (given the resource
scarcity).

I have a bias more toward collaboration than competition, but it is hard to
argue with the results obtained and the similarity to how nature designs life
itself. And even in nature, competition goes hand in had with collaboration,
so perhaps both are beneficial if well balanced. Even evolutionists
have some new theories that give a bigger role to symbiosis between species
in evolution than pure mutation + competition and survival of the fitest.

In this sense the book allowed me to review some of my ideas about constraints
on software development, the role of pressure, scarcity of resources, etc.
Perhaps in some contexts, even time boxing and deadlines can be a positive
force depending on how they are exerted, I'm not sure, but it got me thinking.

Another thing that resembles nature and goes against my biases is the
idea of not doing something "well", no engineer wants to do things not well,
but it is true that not everything needs to be done well, it does depend,
and in nature a lot of things look clumsy and funny, and could be better,
but they are good enough (human eyes are a very odd design, for example).
So as an engineer you want to build all the things well, because you want
to be proud of what you build, but that may not be the path for the
best design, specially when resource constraints are in place.

Also it is interesting when sometimes a project seems like something unworthy
and boring and in the end it turns out to be awesome, material for reflection
indeed. It is also inspiring to see the passion of the engineers involved in
the project.

Another impressive thing is the end of the project, besides the machine being
a success the team that built it ends up dissolving itself, starting with Tom
West itself leaving the team. People in the team did not get the recognition
that they deserved and in the end it is kinda bittersweet, the story ends
in a way that is kinda sad but also beautiful, nothing in the project went
like Tom West imagined and he felt specially sad because he thought that people
would be better rewarded by their hard work, but even though this is sad the
book ends with these words from Tom West:

```
It was a summer romance. But that's all right. Summer romances are some of
the best things that ever happen.
```
