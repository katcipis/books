# The Soul of a Machine

The idea of this great book is to capture the essence of the
process of building a new machine, in this case a computer.
From what I understand this essence or soul of the machine
is comprised of pieces of the individuals that built it
that are left on this machine. Being so the history is much
more about the people building the machine than details
of the machine per se.

This is specially true given that the writer of the book
is a journalist, so he gives a really high level and romantic
view of the process of building the machine, giving emphasis on the
people around it and their behavior and aspirations.

There is a lot of people involved on the building of the machine,
but the main protagonist is Tom West, the guy that conceived
the idea of building the machine and sold it to the rest
of the company and helped assemble the team.

Besides that, for a great part of the book it seems that West 
is doing nothing besides giving creative freedom to the engineers
to conceive the machine, but as is said on the beginning of the book
and made clear at the end, there is more to build a machine than
designing and building a CPU.

The history begins with the construction of a new fancy research
lab that was supposed to the new creative force behind Data General,
the company where the story happens. This lab is built pretty far away from
Data General headquarters and a lot of the engineers did not wanted to move
out but also felt that they have been left behind to do meaningless
work and that all the fun would be on the new lab. The Data General
headquarters was located at Westborough Massachusetts while the new lab
was created at North Carolina.

A war started to brew between the engineers at the Westborough and the
ones at North Carolina, and the winner would get to build a fancy/awesome
new 32 bits machine (called super minicomputers). The one leading the team
at Westborough was Tom West, the protagonist. Both teams made a proposal of
a machine and in the end Tom West and his team lost the battle, the new
fancy project was going to the new lab.

Here is where West ingenuity begins, he thought off and sold the idea of
a 32 bit machine that would be backward compatible with the current
16 bit machine, the Eclipse. Since it had to be backward compatible the
new machine would have much more constraints than the one being developed
at North Carolina, it would not be as pure and free of ugly hacks, it would
have to bear the burden of backwards compatibility.
