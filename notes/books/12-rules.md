# 12 Rules for Life: An antidote to chaos

Usually I would not read a book that seems to be about rules
and at the start of the book I got the same feeling from the
author itself. When so much things seem to be context dependent
what is the point of talking about rules ?

The history of why using rules as the title of the book revolve
around the authors experience using Quora, he started trying to answer
things there and noticed that the post that was by far more popular
was a simple list rules on how to improve your life. So it was
more by popular demand than by authors choice the theme of
the book =P. But the title of the book is just relevant to
the overall structure of the book, the content of each of
the "rules" is filled with ideas that will be context sensitive
and interesting metaphors, from biological assertions on how
we work to interesting interpretations of ancient text like
the bible.

# Safe and Unprepared

Safe places and aversion to risk and damage.
Safe places for ideas too...
Excessive tolerance

# Positive Thought and Biology

Lobster

# World of objects

Nihilism

# World of actors

Actions matters, what you believe matters, values matters.
There is right and wrong, there is virtue.
Having values means confrontation. Confrontation requires
fierceness sometimes (not necessarily violence).

# Genesis

## Priesthood: Voice brings order

Analysis of Genesis 1, priestly history of god bringing
order to creation by the use of spoken word/language.

## The Naked Ape

Unconscious of itself, innocent, as an infant.
Self conciousness and shame
Ashamed to walk with god

It is better to make people under your care to be competent than
protect them, because protecting them is impossible.

Would you raise your kid to be safe or strong ?

## Chaos

Not even god was able to avoid chaos from infiltrating the
orderly paradise. Chaos is inside us, it cannot be removed
and you cant be completely protected from it.
