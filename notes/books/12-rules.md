# 12 Rules for Life: An antidote to chaos

Usually I would not read a book that seems to be about rules
and at the start of the book I got the same feeling from the
author itself. When so much things seem to be context dependent
what is the point of talking about rules ?

The history of why using rules as the title of the book revolve
around the authors experience using Quora, he started trying to answer
things there and noticed that the post that was by far more popular
was a simple list rules on how to improve your life. So it was
more by popular demand than by authors choice the theme of
the book =P. But the title of the book is just relevant to
the overall structure of the book, the content of each of
the "rules" is filled with ideas that will be context sensitive
and interesting metaphors, from biological assertions on how
we work to interesting interpretations of ancient text like
the bible.

# Safe and Unprepared

One of the first interesting ideas presented is how it is rare
these days to find people who can discuss with someone that
has very different political views from you. He tells how he
has two friends (a couple) that always promotes dinners
and parties where there is no taboo and people can discuss
anything, and they do, in a invigorating way, even when
no one else in the end has changed the mind or anything
(that should not be the point of a discussion anyway).

Even my personal experience shows that this is indeed, very
rare. He talks about how this seems related to an upbringing
focused way too much on safety and tolerance. Not that safety or
tolerance are bad things, but as all things you can always
have too much of it.

The safe playground where it is impossible to get hurt, the
safe spaces for discussions in Universities, where there seems
to be an aversion to confrontation, where safely being able
to express yourself means no one will tell you that you are
wrong.

It created a generation of people with aversion to risk
and confrontation. This can be seen clearly when discussing
politics, usually when people don't agree they are labelled
as nazis or socialists and discussion ends. The discomfort
of hearing different ideas from what you believe is intolerable,
which is ironic since these same people usually preach tolerance =P.

And it is intolerance for the wrong thing. It would be great to
not tolerate ideas, but it is an intolerance with being hurt or
wrong. It is dumb and it is a form of infantilization, people
literally don't grow up on these safe environments, because life
is not safe, period.

It is good to not tolerate some things because it means
that you have your own values. If you do have values they
will be eventually incompatible with some idea and tolerating
the idea would mean giving up your value, giving up the good
fight, which seems to be like giving up meaning.

Actions matters, what you believe matters, values matters.
There is right and wrong, there is virtue.
Having values means confrontation. Confrontation requires
fierceness sometimes (not necessarily violence).

## Priesthood: Voice brings order

Analysis of Genesis 1, priestly history of god bringing
order to creation by the use of spoken word/language.

## The Naked Ape

Unconscious of itself, innocent, as an infant.

It is better to make people under your care to be competent than
protect them, because protecting them is impossible.

Would you raise your kid to be safe or strong ?

## Chaos

Not even god was able to avoid chaos from infiltrating the
orderly paradise. Chaos is inside us, it cannot be removed
and you cant be completely protected from it.
