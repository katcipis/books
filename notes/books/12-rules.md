# 12 Rules for Life: An antidote to chaos

Usually I would not read a book that seems to be about rules
and at the start of the book I got the same feeling from the
author itself. When so much things seem to be context dependent
what is the point of talking about rules ?

The history of why using rules as the title of the book revolve
around the authors experience using Quora, he started trying to answer
things there and noticed that the post that was by far more popular
was a simple list rules on how to improve your life. So it was
more by popular demand than by authors choice the theme of
the book =P. But the title of the book is just relevant to
the overall structure of the book, the content of each of
the "rules" is filled with ideas that will be context sensitive
and interesting metaphors, from biological assertions on how
we work to interesting interpretations of ancient text like
the bible.

# Safe Spaces

One of the first interesting ideas presented is how it is rare
these days to find people who can discuss with someone that
has very different political views from you. He tells how he
has two friends (a couple) that always promotes dinners
and parties where there is no taboo and people can discuss
anything, and they do, in a invigorating way, even when
no one else in the end has changed the mind or anything
(that should not be the point of a discussion anyway).

Even my personal experience shows that this is indeed, very
rare. He talks about how this seems related to an upbringing
focused way too much on safety and tolerance. Not that safety or
tolerance are bad things, but as all things you can always
have too much of it.

The safe playground where it is impossible to get hurt, the
safe spaces for discussions in Universities, where there seems
to be an aversion to confrontation, where safely being able
to express yourself means no one will tell you that you are
wrong.

It created a generation of people with aversion to risk
and confrontation. This can be seen clearly when discussing
politics, usually when people don't agree they are labelled
as nazis or socialists and discussion ends. The discomfort
of hearing different ideas from what you believe is intolerable,
which is ironic since these same people usually preach tolerance =P.

And it is intolerance for the wrong thing. It would be great to
not tolerate ideas, but it is an intolerance with being hurt or
wrong. It is dumb and it is a form of infantilization, people
literally don't grow up on these safe environments, because life
is not safe, period.

It is good to not tolerate some things because it means
that you have your own values. If you do have values they
will be eventually incompatible with some idea and tolerating
the idea would mean giving up your value, giving up the good
fight, which seems to be like giving up meaning.

On this part of the book there is some talk about finding
meaning in life, and in the opinion of the author having
values and virtues is an essential part of finding meaning.

# Positive Thought and Biology

The first rule is about walking straight, as a lobster. It seems
kinda funny but in the end there is a quite interesting scientific
argument behind this analogy. Lobster, evolutionary speaking,
are quite old creatures (millions of years). Part of our brains
and systems resembles theirs. The part that he focus is
how winning and losing changes the chemistry of the brain.

Lobster that loses battles and territory have different
chemicals liberated on the brain than the ones that win.
The chemicals helps the winning lobster feel good and strong
and causes the lobster to walk different, lets say, like a winner =P.

Since this causes a vicious circle, the more you win the more you
win, and the more you loose the more you loose, he talks
about a phenomenon that happens not just among humans, but also
on other animals like lobsters, which is the
[Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle).
Even among lobsters it is common to territory to be distributed among
them unevenly.

Of course that just thinking that you are a winner will make you
win, but the chemical changes in your brain if you feel and act
as a winner are real and can help you feel less depressed, at least
in a very basic chemical level.

# World of objects

There is a very interesting idea presented about having two different
world views, one that is a world of objects and the other is a
world of actors.

The world of objects is a more recent idea that has been formed
thanks to scientific advancements, people started to understand
more of how the world physically works.

But thinking like that can lead very easily to
[Nihilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism), specially the
moral one that dictates that values are meaningless. The insistence
on being objective all the time can take you to the conclusion
that nothing actually matters, which may be true in universal
scale but can easily lead to depression in the human mind,
since we are intrinsically emotional, social and theatrical/dramatic.

When you think only about objects and their scale, even our galaxy
are irrelevant giving the entire universe, finding meaning in a world like
this is pointless, because you will be unable to cause any sizeable effect
given the space/time of the entire universe.

# World of actors

The world of actors, the one that humankind has lived most of the
time, is one where actions matters, what you believe matters, values matters.
There is right and wrong, there is virtue. It is a more mythological and
theatrical place, perhaps more disconnected from objective reality, but a more
exciting place to be, where you matter and things can have meaning.

This is so pervasive in the way people where used to model reality that
in the bible, Paul literally explains that the world, humans, everything that
happens is a universal theater for angels. That is much more exciting than
believing that you on a rock travelling in a universe that is so big that
makes your tiny existence utterly irrelevant.

It is kinda like wanting to live in the Matrix, even if it is not real,
seems better than reality. Having conscience and existing can be a burden,
perhaps this tales and mythology where the only way our ancestors found to
cope with this burden, self awareness/consciousness. And if you think that
this is stupid you should question yourself if we have came up with
a better idea to how to cope with this burden.

# Nature

His view of nature is to say the least, delightful. A lot of people today
think about nature in a Victorian way, nature is little birds singing in
the background while you lie in the grass having picnic (like old paintings).
Nothing in this picture is true. To start birds singing are usually for mating
and marking territory, and birds are extremely aggressive with territory.
Why ? Resources are scarce, if you are not aggressive with your source
of resources in nature you will die, and nature is relentless in its will
to kill you, in all forms possible. There is nothing peaceful in nature,
there is balance, but it is not peace in the way humans desire, being 
completely safe.

He tells a personal history about a bird that used to fill all the
other bird houses around his one with sticks to avoid having to share
territory with any other bird. We somehow got used to the idea that
only humans can be dicks and selfish, that is far from true because
in a lot of situations being a dick and selfish can mean survival
and for millions of years survival has always been the game.

It is interesting to consider why we control nature and build cities.
Again it is not like we are evil, we just want to survive, we want the safety,
and nature does not provide that for you. We are only at fault of mastering
nature's own game, which is killing, we got extremely good at it and
got to the top, hate the game not the player =P.

We have created a lack of balance since we are so proficient in fighting
at nature's game, but this is driven by a basic desire to survive. We create
cities and devastate forests because we want our children to survive, the chances
of they surviving in the city are much bigger than the forest, it is
simple like that.

All animals try in some level to shape the environment so it is more safe to
him, we just got really good at it (perhaps too good ?).

# Genesis

On the second rule, about taking care about yourself like
you would take care about others, he talks about how people
usually take better care of their pets than themselves, and
connects this with deep feelings of shame and inadequacy.
He presents a metaphorical interpretation of Genesis (bible)
that strives to explain these feelings of inadequacy.

There also some very interesting ideas regarding the dynamics
of chaos and order. He defends the idea that to have a meaningful
life you need to find the line that separates chaos and order and
put one foot in each side. Too much of each will render you crazy
or depressed.

The previous idea of safe places spoiling people is related to
this, denying people contact with chaos is prejudicial, because
as the biblical metaphor shows, chaos is unavoidable.

## Priesthood: Voice brings order

I was not able to relate this to anything useful yet,
just found interesting that the first chapter of Genesis is
a priestly history of god bringing
order to creation by the use of spoken word/language. Seems
to be a reflex of our contemplation in the role of language
in our development. The bible gives great emphasis to words,
because they shaped our evolution.

## The Naked Ape

On chapter 2 Genesis starts to talk more about man creation
and the details are interesting. One detail is the nakedness,
the emphasis that the bible gives on the fact that before we
where unconscious of ourselves, innocent, as an infant, and given
that we where also not aware that we were naked, nor were we ashamed.

Shame started with also another interesting detail about our
reality, that chaos is unavoidable.
Not even god was able to avoid chaos from infiltrating the
orderly paradise that he created. Chaos is inside us,
it cannot be removed and you cant be completely protected from it.

Chaos itself is also the exciting, the new, the unexplored. So
it is not like a bad thing, but it is filled with uncertainty.
Once the serpent sneakily introduced chaos in gods paradise man
became self conscious, like god, but unlike god that created shame.
Man is described as literally being ashamed to walk with god,
because he was naked.

Why our species developed this shaming for nakedness is an
interesting question. Perhaps walking straight, with our bellies
fully exposed, is extremely dangerous, and the shaming and clothing
served as a way to protect us. Being ashamed of being naked is not
ubiquitous among humans of course, perhaps it is a more social
construct than biological. Yet it is interesting how deep and
old are the feelings of shame and inadequacy in our species. Perhaps
that is an important drive that made us strive to create
everything that we have done so far.

This beginning of humankind is also an important reminder of
the inevitability of chaos and how it is better to make people
under your care to be competent than
protect them, because protecting them from chaos is impossible.

Based on this he makes one very good question for parents:

```
Would you raise your kid to be safe or strong ?
```

Even god was unable to shield his creation from chaos, from the
unexpected and new.
