# Dealers of Lightning: Xerox PARC and the Dawn of the Computer Age

Some notes from the [book](https://www.amazon.com/Dealers-Lightning-Xerox-PARC-Computer-ebook/dp/B0029PBVCA).

# Interactive Computing and Short Sightedness

Sometimes I feel funny by thinking that the opinion of people that seem
smarter than me doesn't make sense, because it is counter intuitive that
I may be seeing something that they don't, and yet when you look at
history it is very normal that people that are exceptionally smart
and created great things can sometimes, given their blind spots and
biases, be also terribly wrong about other things.

One of the first things that surprised me was how a LOT of very talented
engineers saw no future on personal computing and interactive computing
systems, in their view the future was timesharing/batch computing. Of course
it seems obvious today that it was a good idea, but it amazes me how rare
it was to find people like Ivan Sutherland and Alan Kay on the past, people
that saw the potential of the machine as a rich interactive thing, a way to
augment human intellect.

This is mainly caused by the bias, even on very smart/talented
engineers/programmers to see the computer as the end itself, instead
of seeing computers as a means to an end, an end that involves people
and how they interact with computers. They were only able to imagine
other engineers working with machines, their disconnection from humanity
was what allowed them to spend so much time with machines and build
amazing systems, but it was also their blind spot.

Actually this is also another example on how diversity is important in
our field, because the one that pushed the most for interactive computing
and networking was not an engineer, it was a psychologist,
[Licklider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._R._Licklider).

He was the one that invested a lot on networking and interactive computing
using DARPA funding. It also shows how important it is to have smart people
involved on politics, it seems like a hassle, but if smart people just bail
on politics the decisions are left to much lesser people that will
lack the vision to build the future. And it is no exaggeration to say that
it was his funding that built the future, the ARPANET is the precursor of
the internet, and it was all possible thanks to Licklider and ARPA funding.

PARC is connected to ARPA because when the funding started to dry (mainly
because of the Vietnam war) most of the people involved on ARPA research
went to work to PARC.

# Networking

The whole migration from ARPA to PARC reinforced to me how important
networking is, in the sense of knowing the right set of people to build
teams. Hiring processes is extremely hard, in my opinion it is an
unsolvable problem and the best you can do is to have some heuristics.
So knowing the right people to build a research lab is invaluable.

It was so invaluable that it was the main reason that Bob Taylor was hired
by Xerox to build PARC. He did not had any academic credentials and was
usually frowned upon because of that. His behavior was also quite intense
sometimes, the way he pursued his visions, and yet people in management
tolerated him just because of his ability to build and keep awesome teams
together. It feels like just a small thing to do, and yet it is so essential,
specially to research and to tackle hard problems, that "just that" was
enough to keep him employed on PARC.

It feels like very little and yet it seems a lot like what good management
is, find the right people and help maintain the environment they need
to do good work. It is hard to define a process with that and sell it, it is
also very hard to reproduce because it depends on context, that is why I think
most management, even on the software industry, is pretty lame and orbits around
control. It is much easier to teach and write books about control.
You can teach control and how to measure, but you can't teach how to recognize
talent and how to trust (or maybe you can... so far I don't think so).

# McColough Folly

There is a lot of material on what they call the
[McColough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Peter_McColough) folly,
which is basically the history on how a misguided manager wanted Xerox
to invest on computing so bad that he bought a company that was not work even
a few millions for a astounding one billion dollars. The company he bought
did not even come close of giving something like 10 million dollars profit.

Again, when you see things like this you imagine that people with a lot of
experience and lots of responsibility will make sensible decisions, well
sometimes they will but sometimes they will make very stupid decisions too.
The main mistake he made was doing most of the negotiation and decision
making alone, almost any engineer at Xerox at the time knew it was a mistake.

# Religion and Dogma

There are also some histories about how religion and dogma got in the
way of getting things done. The first one is the history on how PARC
"stole" a lot of talent from
[Engelbart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart). This mainly
happened because of Engelbart dogmatic/religious behavior, at least
this was one of the reasons mentioned by a lot of people that left
him in order to get something done.

PARC itself was victim of that, even very smart people after being right
sometimes can become dogmatic. One example of this was when they rejected
the GPU idea (which today is common place and a billionaire industry).

On the words of Bert Sutherland, the guy that proposed GPUs:

```
They were the best, the problem is that they knew it.
They developed some prejudices and shot down good ideas too fast.
```

This made PARC a very smart place but at the same time very
insular and disconnected from the rest of the world. Even if
most of the ideas from the outside world were not great, a few
were and they were unable to explore these good ideas because
of their dogmatic behavior (and arrogance).

There is also an interesting
[blog post](https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2019/01/notes-from-1984-trip-to-xerox-parc.html)
from Rob Pike were he also talks about how PARC was insular, disconnected
from the rest of the world. As any property on a system this can make
disrupting ideas easier to built since you are ignoring the perceptions
from the outside world, but also buts you in danger of ignoring
important things that are happening around you.

In the end, besides blind spots and biases, it seems that avoiding
dogmatism is also hard, even among very smart people.

# Failure

It is a very normal human emotion to feel good about other people
failures =P, not because you like seeing people failing by itself but
because it makes you more in peace with your own shortcomings and
failures. It can also move you not give up and keep trying, this is
specially true if the person that failed kept trying and built
great things.

There is a lot of failures histories on the book, but one that caught my
attention was one about Alan Kay. He is one of the most eloquent
people that I know and he is very passionate about his ideas, so it is
very hard to imagine him failing to convey his ideas and being speechless.

And yet that is what happened the first time he tried to present the idea
of building 30 personal computers to the entire lab. The lab director at
the time, Elkind, simply destroyed the idea in public as something that
made very little sense. Alan Kay was left speechless and even cried after
the presentation. I can easily imagine this happening to me, but reading
about this happening with someone like Alan Kay makes you see that
success histories are usually filled with monumental failures.

In the end he was able to pursue his vision with the Altos, which would be
one of the first personal computers with rich interactivity, but even that
was kind serendipitous, after his failure some people that were really
interested on the challenge of building the Alto just approached Kay and
offered to build it in partnership with him.

# Disagreements

Since PARC was filled with very smart and opinionated people it was
very common for disagreements to exist. Usually people understood each
other and worked together despite that, but sometimes that was not possible.
They even came up with a "class 1 disagreement" thing that meant
two people were incompatible in a way that made it impossible for them
to work together. It is very rare but I have felt something similar about
a few people. Difference is good, specially for brainstorming, but sometimes
differences are so fundamental that the chances of consensus are zero.
I always assumed it was a failure on my part, maybe it isn't, maybe this
just happens sometimes, not everyone can work together well.
