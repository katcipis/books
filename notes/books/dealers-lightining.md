# Dealers of Lightning: Xerox PARC and the Dawn of the Computer Age

Some notes from the [book](https://www.amazon.com/Dealers-Lightning-Xerox-PARC-Computer-ebook/dp/B0029PBVCA).

# Short Sight

Sometimes I feel funny by thinking that the opinion of people that seem
smarter than me doesn't make sense, because it is counter intuitive that
I may be seeing something that they don't, and yet when you look at
history it is very normal that people that are exceptionally smart
and created great things can sometimes, given their blind spots and
biases, were also terribly wrong about other things.

One of the first things that surprised me was how a LOT of very talented
engineers saw no future on personal computing and interactive computing
systems, in their view the future was timesharing/batch computing. Of course
it seems obvious today that it was a good idea, but it amazes me how rare
it was to find people like Ivan Sutherland and Alan Kay on the past, people
that saw the potential of the machine as a rich interactive thing, a way to
augment human intellect.

Actually this is also another example on how diversity is important in
our field, because the one that pushed the most for interactive computing
and networking was not an engineer, it was a psychologist,
[Licklider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._R._Licklider).

He was the one that invested a lot on networking and interactive computing
using DARPA funding. It also shows how important it is to have smart people
involved on politics, it seems like a hassle, but if smart people just bail
on politics the decisions are left to much lesser people that will
lack the vision to build the future. And it is no exaggeration to say that
it was his funding that built the future, the ARPANET is the precursor of
the internet, and it was all possible thanks to Licklider and ARPA funding.

PARC is connected to ARPA because when the funding started to dry (mainly
because of the Vietnam war) most of the people involved on ARPA research
went to work to PARC.
