# The Making Of Prince Of Persia

The [book](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Prince-Persia-Journals-1985-1993-Illustrated-dp-0578627310/dp/0578627310/)
is written as a collection of diary entries, which makes it a very interesting
reading, getting into the head of the author.

## Predicting the Future

One of the first things that caught my attention is again a very bizarre/wrong
prediction of the future related to the gaming industry. On The Masters Of Doom,
Carmack and Romero thought they already lost the gravy train of the gaming
industry, that the chance to do something amazing and make an impact had already
passed. Jordan Mechner also thought that games for PCs were something that
was dying and was not sure if it would be worth it to invest on it.

Kinda funny how so much people involved on making games thought that the
industry was starting to die, and its golden days have passed. Nothing could be
further than the truth, the gaming industry just got bigger. It changed a lot,
but it is very far away from dying.

## Uncertainty

I really like the idea of embracing uncertainty and doubt, not as some kind of
weakness, but as a way to embrace reality and what you don't know. Most people
that are certain, when observed from the outside, seem to be under some sort
of illusion, at least for me.

Since I'm strongly biased towards uncertainty it is always cool to observe people
who built great stuff and yet were filled with doubt. There is this illusion that
people who built great stuff are always determined and certain. He certainly wasn't,
along almost an year he was drown in doubt.

Jordan was not sure either if it was worth it to make a game, and even if it was
he was very unsure if he was actually able to make a game again.

He developed the game [Karateka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karateka_(video_game)),
which was a huge success for the time it was developed, selling 500K units. And yet,
he had doubts if he still got it, he felt like his coding skills had atrophied.
Which is something that I always feel, all the time, when I end up working with
different aspects of software development and then have this feeling that I would
not be able to do what I used to anymore.

Another interesting thing that made myself identify with the author a lot was
a lack of ability into reproducing what he made at Karateka, he didn't remembered
how he made Karateka, all that was involved, and was not sure if he could reproduce
the whole thing again. It feels like things just happen, on the right time,
and magic happens, and later you are not very sure how you were able to do
what you did.

I feel the exact same thing about a lot of things that I did on the past,
it is very cool to see someone sharing similar feelings, specially someone so
accomplished (making entire games by yourself along years is a big accomplishment
on my book =P).

## Attention to Detail

Even though  he had a lot of doubts regarding his own skills, it is obvious that
what made him great was attention to detail, in my opinion it always is, and that
is why it is hard to find people who are great on creative work, because 
attention to detail is not something that comes easy on our species.

He reviewed some ports of Karateka to other platforms and it lacked so much
in attention to detail that he couldn't even provide clear criticism about it,
it would need to be remade in his opinion. That strengthened his confidence
on him being able to make games, because at the same time that he didn't
think he was very good, he was able to see how much lack of attention
to detail other people had on their games, so maybe he was not that bad =P.

Also identified myself a lot with this, it is odd how you can really believe
that you are no good, and yet when you see other work you have a lot of
criticism and then you realize maybe you are not that bad.

Maybe a mind with attention to detail + lots of critical thinking is
essential for good design, but that also makes for a mind that will always
be very self critical and disappointed with itself, filled with doubts, and
maybe that is OK.
