# Rework

Notes for the [Rework](https://basecamp.com/books/rework) book.
There was not very new on the book (for me at least), but
nonetheless it is a good book, most of the ideas make sense.

# Curator

Liked the metaphor about being a curator when dealing
with software. Museums are just about as what is left
outside them than what is inside. Being a good curator
is to know what to left out. You could even argue
that knowing what to left out is even more important
than adding the right stuff. It feels better to be wrong
on the side of less than the side of more.

Another example used are restaurants, the worse ones are
the ones with gigantic menus that try to do everything.
There is a famous show about a dude that helps restaurants
that are struggling and the first thing that he always does
is to check the menu and cut back on a lot of stuff, focus on
less and in doing it well.

When things are going bad in a company/project the solution
is not to throw more money and people at it, chances are it
will only make it worse since communication is not free.
The solution is to find out what you can cut back.
