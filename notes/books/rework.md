# Rework

Notes for the [Rework](https://basecamp.com/books/rework) book.
There was nothing very new on the book (for me at least), but
nonetheless it is a good book, most of the ideas make sense.

# Curator

Liked the metaphor about being a curator when dealing
with software. Museums are just about as what is left
outside them than what is inside. Being a good curator
is to know what to left out. You could even argue
that knowing what to left out is even more important
than adding the right stuff. It feels better to be wrong
on the side of less than the side of more.

Another example used are restaurants, the worse ones are
the ones with gigantic menus that try to do everything.
There is a famous show about a dude that helps restaurants
that are struggling and the first thing that he always does
is to check the menu and cut back on a lot of stuff, focus on
less and in doing it well.

When things are going bad in a company/project the solution
is not to throw more money and people at it, chances are it
will only make it worse since communication is not free.
The solution is to find out what you can cut back.

# Constraints

As I get older I find fascinating the role of constraints
in design. It is counter intuitive, because it is uncomfortable
to be constrained, but it seems essential to good design
and good ideas. This reminds me of this, from the
[Taste for Makers](http://www.paulgraham.com/taste.html) essay:

```
When Bauhaus designers adopted Sullivan's "form follows function,"
what they meant was, form should follow function.

And if function is hard enough, form is forced to follow it,
because there is no effort to spare for error.

Wild animals are beautiful because they have hard lives.
```

When there is room for error, errors are made. Nature is filled
with amazing designs because less than amazing would die, there is
not much resources going around, so you need to be smart, all
sorts of amazing symbioses emerges, because it is needed.
Unconstrained/unlimited resources would probably generate an
endless horde of useless blobs since any crap will do.

I have this feeling regarding web/cloud development. Any sort of
stupid idea/design survives, because almost anything will work, because
the amount of resources is gigantic/elastic. There is no room for
clever ideas, any stupid idea will do. Perhaps this is great
for business (although I doubt it), but for me personally it is
terrible, since I'm not interested on stupid.

There is elegance in efficiency and less, it is not just a matter of
optimization, it makes things simpler and easier to understand, and almost
everything on the web/cloud feels bloated and complicated, probably
because it can, there is very little constraint to kill bad/bloated ideas.

As I was reading this book I was also playing the director's cut version
of Bioshock. I absolutely love that game, it is of a master piece level for
me, and it was surprising to discover that they have a lot of severe
limitations that drove the entire game narrative, like the idea of a underwater
city because it was easier,given their limitations, to create a game
that did not happen at open spaces/open world, and this is one of the most
attractive aspects of the game, it feels very original and well executed,
but it was driven by pure necessity, they had to be creative.

# Interruptions

This book is legendary on how it approaches meetings as categorizing
them as toxic, and I can't agree more. Meetings and sync communication
is not the same thing as good communication. Specially with people
that creates things, that does creative work, interruptions have
a high toll, which pushes you toward optimizing to asynchronous
communication.

One cool analogy on the behavior of the brain related to interruptions
is REM sleep. You take hours to achieve REM sleep on the brain, if you
wake up on the middle of REM sleep, interrupting it, as you sleep again
it will take hours to get to it again, the brain just doesn't resumes from
where it stopped, because it is not how our brain works at all.

For mechanic repetitive tasks we can resume pretty well, but on the
subject of ideas and creativity an interruption is just as destructive.
People who don't do creative work feels like this is an exaggeration,
but it truly isn't, people with much better credentials than me agrees:

* [Makers Schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)
* [Good and Bad Procrastination](http://www.paulgraham.com/procrastination.html)

And the book itself incentives towards practices that empower
people to build their own schedules, so they can have alone time
on the part of the day that is more important to them. This means
using asynchronous text communication as a way to collaborate,and
making synchronous communication the exception, which for creative
work makes perfect sense. Synchronous communication only makes sense
for things that are urgent, and things most of the time are not
actually urgent in software development, and discussing them
calmly and in a well structured manner will most certainly produce
a better result.

I have felt myself the effect of losing control of my
schedule by being forced to go to meetings, after some years
not having to do that, and it feels terrible. I completely
agree with Paul Graham on the sense that it can destroy my entire
day, specially regarding hard problems (you end up doing a set
of more menial tasks on a day that is ravaged by meetings).

# Hiring

Just hire when it hurts, when you hire people, if they are not
truly needed usually work will be "found" to keep them busy, that
is bad business, it must be crystal clear why you hired someone.

If the drive is "we need to go faster", really think, like REALLY think
if what is making you go slow today is lack of people, or lack of something
else. In a lot of scenarios less is more, perhaps you need less of the
right people (the wrong engineer can create more problems that what he/she
solves).

Hire the better writer. That makes perfect sense to me, I have worked with
my share of people who seem to be extremely lazy to read and write. It seems
pretty hard to be a reasonably good engineer without reading and writing
considerably. The lazy ones usually have an ad-hoc method of "just ask me on slack"
(or whatever it is used for chatting these days). This is not good engineering,
this is lazy and egocentric, you get to not properly think about stuff
and explain it and you get to be the awesome guru who knows everything
and answers all questions.

Good code is decoupled from the person who wrote it, a good engineer
has value not because of the work he as done in the past but because
of the work he/she still can do in the future. For that to be true
the engineer needs to know how to write, how to explain ideas to others
clearly, via text in a form that doesn't need him to fill out gaps.

Also hire slowly, if you hire too fast you end up with something that
resembles cocktail parties, there is a lot of people being overly nice
with each other (and not completely honest) because no one knows anyone
and everyone feels uncomfortable.
