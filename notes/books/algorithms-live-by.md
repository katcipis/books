# Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions

As the title makes clear this book is about making comparisons
to common computer science algorithms and human behavior.

There is a lot that can be taken from computer science and math
to the day to day life, for example one of the first topics
of the book is the [optimal stopping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_stopping)
problem, which is a classic from math that a lot of people
don't know but can be really useful if you are looking for an
apartment and want to know how much time you should spend just
looking before committing to an apartment.

It goes a great deal on sorting and searching also, remembering
that sorting only makes sense when you actually need to search
and the searching cost is not negligible. One simple example
is your personal library of books, it will usually be not
that big and sorting it will bring you little value given the
effort (at least O(n logn)). But for a huge library it is
essential. The library subject is very rich because it encompasses
both sorting, searching and caching. Caching was one of the
most interesting topics to me and merits its own section,
not because of the computer science aspect of it but because
it made me feel less lame as I get old =P.
