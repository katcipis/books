# Meetings

For quite some time I haven't gave much thought about
meetings because I worked free from them for some years,
as soon as I was exposed to them again the effect on me was
surprising, not that I expected it to feel nice, but it stressed
me much more than I expected (perhaps I'm just getting old) and
that got me thinking on why it pissed me off that much.

Besides the reason for stress and discomfort, I will also
try to explain some other not as stressful inefficiencies
of meetings and also why it is so easy for management to
oversee these issues and also why developers sometimes "ask"
for meetings.

# Schedule Control and Interruptions

This one is a more subtle source of stress, which is the
lack of control of your own schedule. This is specially
true for me because I have very little control over when
I feel energetic and inspired to tackle hard problems, if
this moment coincides with meetings this causes a great
deal of loss of productivity and stress/anxiety. It can be even
worse then a lack of productivity, because the ideas you would
have in this time of bliss may not be achieved in a different
time and you will end up with a suboptimal solution (specially
if you need to deliver something soon, you can't wait for another
inspired moment).

The only way to avoid this is to have an average performance
all the time, like a robot. Since humans are not robots I don't
think anyone is capable of this regarding creative work. If your
work is repetitive and does not require imagination/creative effort,
then having control over your schedule to capture inspiration
is less important, it is easier to be interrupted and then
go back to work.

So "creative work" ends up being tasks
that you actually have to think to perform, our brains excel at
auto pilot modes, because they are very cheap, anything that you
can do on auto pilot will be easier to be interrupted and resumed.
And our brains are so good at it that even considerably hard tasks,
like driving, can be extremely automated on the brain (think about
how hard was to learn how to drive and then how easy it is to drive
today, thanks brain =P).

A lot of programming can be done on auto pilot, the book
[The Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/book/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)
even talks about this, but as something that you need to avoid
if you want to keep getting better at it, so good programmers
will usually avoid auto pilot mode and will strive to be on the
full creative mode as much as possible, hence the preference for
full control over their schedules.

If may feel funny to talk about inspiration when discussing programming/engineering,
but any work that has any form of creativity on it, where you are making
something that you have never done before, will require some inspiration
since you are creating. This is usually related to art since it is a
pure creative endeavor, but it is also present on programming. To be
completely absent from creativity you would need to be rewriting an
exact copy of a program that you did before and in the exact same way
(auto pilot mode on), anything that escapes this,
even rewriting a program with a different design, will be creative work
and will be liable to inspirational issues.
Without inspiration sometimes you can make progress, but the end result
will probably be less than what could be achieved.

Another important thing about inspiration and creative work is how long
it takes to get on the right place (in your mind), and how bad
interruptions can be. It is very common to take hours to get to a specific
state on your mind, while creating something. When you are interrupted for
a few minutes it will not take just a few minutes to go back to the
previous state, it will take hours again, this is just how our brains work.

This can be hard to understand and even harder to prove (if possible),
another phenomenon that is very important to our health and can be
used as an example is
[REM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep) sleep.
The [Rework](https://basecamp.com/books/rework)
book uses it as an example of brain function
that gets screwed up by interruptions. REM sleep can take hours to start, if
you interrupt it by awakening, sleeping again doesn't immediately gets you
back to REM sleep, it doesn't even take a few minutes, it will take the same
amount of hours again to get to REM. Losing state is a full reset on the brain,
so you have the whole context rebuilding to do after it.

REM sleep doesn't prove anything related to concentration/inspiration, but it is
an example on how state on the brain after lost
can be pretty hard to be built again, and inspiration is a state of the mind.
Other programmers with much more experience and much smarter than me
have similar feelings (sometimes I think I'm oversensitive), from 
[Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html):

```
I find one meeting can sometimes affect a whole day.
A meeting commonly blows at least half a day, by breaking up
a morning or afternoon.

But in addition there's sometimes a cascading effect.
If I know the afternoon is going to be broken up,
I'm slightly less likely to start something ambitious in the morning.

I know this may sound oversensitive, but if you're a maker,
think of your own case. Don't your spirits rise at the thought
of having an entire day free to work, with no appointments at all?

Well, that means your spirits are correspondingly depressed when
you don't. And ambitious projects are by definition close to the
limits of your capacity. A small decrease in morale is enough to kill them off.
```

But at the same time, communication is fundamental in any social endeavor,
and most software in the world falls down on the social endeavor category
(more than one programmer), so how to assess this ? Asynchronous communication,
which is usually done via text. But don't be fooled, if you use text communication
but expect people to answer in a matter of minutes, or even one hour, that is
not true asynchronous communication, this is synchronous communication via
text, because of the simple reason that you will be interrupting people
and removing control of their schedule. Truly asynchronous communication
will enable people to disconnect from any form of interruption for a period of
4 hours and then come back. Four hours is not exact science, but just one
hour for sure seems to be too little for hard problems, the number four
comes from my own opinion plus a reinforcement from the
[Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) essay.


# High Cost

The hidden cost of meetings can be tricky, mainly because a good part
of the cost is hidden under the assumption that if you have a meeting of one
hour in the middle of the day you will loose something like 2 hours tops
of productivity, which is wrong, depending on the sort of problem you
are working on you can loose the entire day (more on this later).

But even doing a very optimistic measurement of the cost of meetings make
them much less attractive than people seem to think they are.

One good way to evaluate meetings is not if they are useful or not, some
meetings do produce some good results, the issue is, are they efficient ?
Specially if compared to other alternatives ?

Right now (2020) I'm on the EU so I will do some back of the envelope
calculations using the average salary in EUR for software engineers.
Lets say the average salary is 65000 EUR per year, this will create a per
day salary of 178 EUR, which for 8 hours day of work is equivalent to
22 EUR per hour. So a meeting with 10 engineers for one hour would
cost 220 EUR being extremely optimistic. Being just optimistic and
calculating using 2 hours of interruption for a 1 hour meeting, you
get 440 EUR. If this is a weekly thing you are up to 1760 EUR of cost per month,
and this is a very optimistic case, and just for 10 engineers. I saw meetings
with much more than 10 people (close to 30) and in a company that was not
making a profit (every penny matters).

Well no one is stupid, so of course these meetings have some benefits,
it is a matter of cost VS benefits and alternatives. Given the benefits, does
the cost justifies it ? Is it the best investment you can do right now
(think about ROI) ? Even if the investment is good, do you have money
to do it right now ? (small companies that behave like big ones usually
do bad investments for example)

If communication is required, does it need to be synchronous ? Specially
presentations, where there is no brainstorming or discussion at all, it
seems that synchronizing everyone together in a meeting with a presentation 
is more like an emotional experience than a pragmatic way to achieve
something (an email to everyone could solve it). Emotion has its importance,
just keep in mind how much you are paying for emotion. Also remember that
the warm embrace of human contact in a meeting is something that some
programmers will not prefer over the high cost of interruption, and there
are other less disruptive ways to achieve human contact and
communication among peers.


# Enables Auto Mode

I already talked about the auto mode before, and it can be pretty
detrimental to improving the design of existing code and also
to the development of an engineer career, the difference between
deliberate practice (thinking about what you are doing) and auto
mode is the difference of a programmer with 10 years of experience
and one with 1 year of experience and 9 years repeating the same
previous experience.

An environment filled with meetings will foster auto mode work,
because it is the only kinda of work that you will be able to do.
It gets worse, you are optimizing for keeping the programmers who
work like that (the ones that just repeat their previous experiences
on auto mode) and letting the ones that want to improve go,
because they will want to go, because the work will be frustrating
for them since they can't do true creative work, like rethinking
solutions entirely or solving hard problems.  


# Different Schedules

Hands down one of the best explanation on the how conflict around
meetings between management and programmers is Paul Graham essay
[Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html).

The core idea seems to be that managers work on chunks of an hour of work, while
makers work on chunks of at least 4 hours. If you are doing hard creative work,
like solving a problem that you never solved before, you will need more than
an hour to get anywhere, sometimes it takes hours just to get on the
right context, like loading all your own experience that can be useful
and all the peculiarities of the problem. Since makers know this, they
know that a meeting of one hour in the middle of the afternoon will
effectively kill the afternoon.

It is not like you will sit idle all
afternoon, but you won't be able to tackle that hard problem that
is annoying you, or a redesign that can save a lot of time in the future,
you will need to attack simpler/less important tasks, usually work that
is more mechanic that you can do in auto mode. Or even worse, you feel
pressured to solve the hard problem without proper context loading
and consideration and will end up with a botched/crappy solution.

Besides the asynchronous communication solution proposed before, when there
is no alternative besides the meeting he gives a nice idea on how
to approach that:

```
How do we manage to advise so many startups on the
maker's schedule? By using the classic device for simulating
the manager's schedule within the maker's: office hours.

Several times a week I set aside a chunk of time to meet founders
we've funded. These chunks of time are at the end of my working day,
and I wrote a signup program that ensures all the appointments within
a given set of office hours are clustered at the end.

Because they come at the end of my day these meetings are never an interruption.
```

This does resonate with me, I never thought explicitly about any of this,
after doing some thinking and reading his essay it really seems that meetings
on the end of the day will be in general a good idea, specially if they are on
the management side of things. The only exception I think
would be a brainstorm session among engineers, that can be done organically when
everyone involved feels comfortable to discuss and it may be done on the beginning
of the day so it can bootstrap the coding along the rest of the day. In some
cases this can also be done asynchronously with text, which makes it easier
to find the best time for everyone to get involved.

# Lack of Feedback and Coordination

Now on defense of frustrated managers =). One very good advice I read
once, and don't remember where sadly, is that every time you see yourself
in a useless meeting ask yourself why, specially because the why may
be related to you.

A lot of programmers complain a lot of meeting but make no effort in provide
feedback about ongoing features. Refactorings and challenges found during
development are not properly communicated to managers, all that they see is
a black box, where nothing is coming out, this lack of visibility is unnerving,
specially because managers are usually responsible for teams performance.

So, in the absence of proper feedback from programmers, meetings will be
enforced upon them. The most recent "agile" version of this would be daily
meetings, which I tried to apply in three different organizations
and never made much sense for me.

Another common case is programmers not talking among them, lack of
coordination on situations where coordination were required. If you don't do
it yourself, under your own schedule, someone will enforce this upon you, usually
in a not very efficient and disruptive manner (sometimes almost useless, like
meetings with the wrong people, or again daily meetings).

Sometimes stupid shit is enforced upon you by
reasons beyond your control, but sometimes it may be your fault.
