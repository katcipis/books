# Meetings

For quite some time I haven't gave much thought about
meetings because I worked free from them for some years,
as soon as I was exposed to them again the effect on me was
surprising, not that I expected it to feel nice, but it stressed
me much more than I expected (perhaps I'm just getting old) and
that got me thinking on why it pissed me off that much.

Besides the reason for stress and discomfort, I will also
try to explain some other not as stressful inefficiencies
of meetings and also why it is so easy for management to
oversee these issues and also why developers sometimes "ask"
for meetings.

# Schedule Control and Interruptions

This one is a more subtle source of stress, which is the
lack of control of your own schedule. This is specially
true for me because I have very little control over when
I feel energetic and inspired to tackle hard problems, if
this moment coincides with meetings this causes a great
deal of loss of productivity and stress/anxiety. It can be even
worse then a lack of productivity, because the ideas you would
have in this time of bliss may not be achieved in a different
time and you will end up with a suboptimal solution (specially
if you need to deliver something soon, you can't wait for another
inspired moment).

The only way to avoid this is to have an average performance
all the time, like a robot, since humans are not robots I don't
think anyone is capable of this regarding creative work. If your
work is repetitive and does not require imagination/creative effort
then having control over your schedule to capture inspiration
is less important, it is more easy to be interrupted and then
go back to work. In the end "creative work" ends up being tasks
that you actually have to think to perform, our brains excel at
auto pilot modes, because they are very cheap, anything that you
can do at auto pilot will be easier to be interrupted and resumed.
A lot of programming can be done on auto pilot, the book
[The Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/book/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)
even talks about this, but as something that you need to avoid
if you want to keep getting better at it, so good programmers
will usually avoid auto pilot mode and will strive to be on the
full creative mode as much as possible, hence the preference for
full control over their schedules.

If may feel funny to talk about inspiration when discussing programming/engineering,
but any work that has any form of creativity on it, where you are making
something that you have never done before, will require some inspiration
since you are creating. This is usually related to art since it is a
pure creative endeavor, but it is present on any creative work. To be
completely absent from creativity you would need to be rewriting an
exact copy of something that you did before and in the exact same way
(auto pilot mode on), anything that escapes this,
even improving something, will be creative work and will be liable
to inspirational issues. Without inspiration you can make progress,
but the end result will probably be less than what could be achieved.

Another important thing about inspiration and creative work is how long
it takes to get on the right place (in your mind), and how bad
interruptions can be. It is very common to take hours to get to a specific
state on your mind, while creating something, when you are interrupted, for
a few minutes it will not take just a few minutes to go back to the
previous state, it will take hours again, this is just how our brains
work.

This can be hard to understand and even harder to prove, another phenomenon
that is very important to our health and can be used as an example is 
[REM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep) sleep.
The [Rework](https://basecamp.com/books/rework)
book uses it as an example of brain function
that gets screwed up by interruptions. REM sleep can take hours to start, if
you interrupt it by awakening, sleeping again doesn't immediately gets you
back to REM sleep, it will take the same amount of hours again to get to REM.

It doesn't prove anything related to concentration/inspiration but it is
a more clear and easy to prove example on how state on the brain after lost
can be pretty hard to be built again, and inspiration is a state of the mind.

But at the same time, communication is fundamental in any social endeavor,
and most software in the world falls down on the social endeavor category
(more than one programmer), so how to assess this ? Asynchronous communication,
which is usually done via text. But don't be fooled, if you use text communication
but expect people to answer in a matter of minutes, or even one hour, that is
not true asynchronous communication, this is synchronous communication via
text, because of the simple reason that you will be interrupting people
and removing control of their schedule. Truly asynchronous communication
will enable people to disconnect from any form of interruption for a period of
4 hours and then come back (more on the 4 hours period later, it is not exact
science, but just one hour for sure seems to be too little for hard problems).


# High Cost

The hidden cost of meetings can be tricky, mainly because a good part
of the cost is hidden under the assumption that if you have a meeting of one
hour in the middle of the day you will loose something like 2 hours tops
of productivity, which is wrong, depending on the sort of problem you
are working on you can loose the entire day (more on this later).

But even doing a very optimistic measurement of the cost of meetings make
them much less attractive than people seem to think they are.

One good way to evaluate meetings is not if they are useful or not, some
meetings do produce some good results, the issue is, are they efficient ?
Specially if compared to other alternatives ?

Right now (2020) I'm on the EU so I will do some back of the envelope
calculations using the average salary in EUR for software engineers.
Lets say the average salary is 65000 EUR per year, this will create a per
day salary of 178 EUR, which for 8 hours day of work is equivalent to
22 EUR per hour. So a meeting with 10 engineers for one hour would
cost 220 EUR being extremely optimistic, being just optimistic and
calculating using 2 hours of interruption for a 1 hour meeting, you
get 440 EUR. If this is a weekly thing you are up to 1760 EUR of cost per month,
and this is a very optimistic case, and just for 10 engineers. I saw meetings
with much more than 10 people (close to 30) and in a company that was not
making a profit (every penny matters).

Well no one is stupid, so of course these meetings have some benefits,
it is a matter of cost VS benefits and alternatives. Given the benefits, does
the cost justifies it ? Is it the best investment you can do right now
(think about ROI) ?

If communication is required, does it need to be synchronous ? Specially
presentations, where there is no brainstorming or discussion at all, it
seems that synchronizing everyone together in a meeting with a presentation 
is more like an emotional experience than a pragmatic way to achieve
something (an email to everyone could solve it). Emotion has its importance,
just keep in mind how much you are paying for emotion. Also remember that
the warm embrace of human contact in a meeting is something that some
programmers will not prefer over the high cost of interruption, and there
are other less disruptive ways to achieve human contact and
communication among peers.
