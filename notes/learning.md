# Learning Engineering

It is an interesting subject, how do you learn to be a software engineer,
some ideas I had so far because of my own experience.

## Keep Curious

* SICP preface
* Alan Kay OOPSLA (We dont know what we are doing)
* Coders at work (no consensus about any best practice)
* Coders at work Joe Armstrong

## Keep Busy

The best way to learn is by doing.
Use Dennis Ritchie quote on the best way to learn to program in a language

## Keep Learning

Specially languages, with different paradigms.
Mention the pragmatic programmer + Dijkstra impressions on how language
affect how we think.

Also some good books on ideas on how to develop proper code/distributed systems.

## Keep Digging

Mention Thorsten Ball on always working on a layer bellow the one you
usually need.

Joe Armstron on Coders at Work on "Opening Black Boxes".

Abstractions can be great, but do open as much of them as you can =).

Links to curiosity.

## Keep Writing

Writing as a way to organize your thoughts.
Also some SQ3R from Pragmatic Thinking and Learning.
