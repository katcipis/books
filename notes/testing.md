Interest material on the topic of testing.

## [The History of JUnit and the Future of Testing with Kent Beck](https://www.se-radio.net/2010/09/episode-167-the-history-of-junit-and-the-future-of-testing-with-kent-beck/)

Demistifies a lot of dogma surrounding TDD, like you have to do it all the time,
the only way to get a good design is with testing (not true), etc.

Also debunks TDD as something different from BDD, as usual just a misunderstanding
and people getting to hung up on classification. Good stuff. It has very little to
do with actual JUnit, which is good =P.

## [Programmer Test Principles](https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/programmer-test-principles-d01c064d7934)

One of the best/short materials available to showcase how there is no right answers
on testing, just tradeoffs, and you should not marry with any particular
approaches to how test. Also elucidates a lot on the perils of over-mocking
and coupling too much into structure.
